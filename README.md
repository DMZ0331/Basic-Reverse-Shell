# Basic-Reverse-Shell
My first reverse shell project. My goal is to create a persistent reverse shell and progress it into an advanced tool that bypasses security measures.

How to use:
in a terminal use python3 reverseShell.py

Create a netcat listener:
nc -lvp 4444

*Note - Ive added a simple print statement to print when a connection is established and when the connection is closed.
